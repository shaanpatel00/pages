## SVG Images

Created using Inkscape Vector Graphics Editor

### Designs using my first name

These were just some fun designs to help learn the program

---

#### Graffiti

I first started off learning vector designs using my name:

![Shaan Graffiti SVG](./assets/graffiti.png)

---

#### Glitch Effect

Glitch effect with my name. First time using boolean operations with vectors to make interesting designs.

![Shaan Glitch SVG](./assets/glitch-text.png)

---

#### Wood Carving

Carved wood effect generated by adding Gaussian blur to text and adding layer masks to images.

![Shaan Carved Wood SVG](./assets/wood-carving.png)

---

#### Liquid Text

Liquid text style created using a combination of skills learned previously like boolean operations, layer masks, and blurs along with new skills like vignette.

---

#### Neon Text

Neon text effect created with multiple layers, each with different amounts of blur and different saturations to give the illusion of light emitting onto the background.

### More Practice with basic vectorization and simple designs

---

#### Cartoon Styling

Recreated the popular Superman emblem using bezier curves and paths

![Superman Cartoon SVG](./assets/superman-cartoon.png)

---

#### Batman Vector Diagram

Following the same technique as the Superman emblem, I recreated the Batman vector image, but only made half of the design and mirrored it as a means of improving workflow.

---

#### Text Path Manipulation

Worked with modifying text paths to create shapes. In this case, I streched and modified the word "Rhino" into the shape of the animal.

#### Vectorizing A Picture of a falcon

Began using skills I had been developing to vectorize a picture of a falcon.

### Experiementation with realistic materials and shadings

---

Created a personal logo for use on USB drives

---

#### Vectorized Donut

Followed an online tutorial to create a realistic vector donut.

![Donut SVG](./assets/donut.png)

---

#### Metallics

Followed and modified an online tutorial to generate a metallic Flash emblem

![Flash SVG](./assets/flash.png)

---

#### Metallics Part II

Used a previous vector design and metallic texturing skills to create a metallic Superman emblem
